-- Flowkyn — Two Truths: verify related tables, ensure game_votes matches code
-- Date: 2026-03-24
--
-- Backend expects:
--   INSERT INTO game_votes (game_session_id, round_id, participant_id, statement_id)
--   ON CONFLICT (game_session_id, round_id, participant_id) DO UPDATE ...
--
-- Run in psql / Neon SQL editor against the SAME database as DATABASE_URL.
-- If ADD CONSTRAINT fails, run the backfill + DELETE steps again, then re-run.
